# Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are methods used to find a particular item (or items) with specified properties within a collection of data. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are widely used in various applications, including databases, information retrieval systems, and more.

## Here are some common searching algorithms:

### Linear Search:

Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the collection until the target element is found or the entire collection is traversed.
It is suitable for small collections or unsorted collections.
- Time complexity: O(n) - linear time complexity.

### Binary Search:

Binary search is a more efficient searching algorithm that requires the collection to be sorted.
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found or the interval is empty.
It is suitable for large sorted collections.
- Time complexity: O(log n) - logarithmic time complexity.

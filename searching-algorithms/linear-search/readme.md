# Linear Search Algorithm

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element of a collection (such as an array or a list) until the target element is found or the entire collection is traversed. It is one of the most straightforward searching algorithms and is suitable for small collections or when the elements are not sorted.

## Here's how linear search works:

1. Start at the beginning: The algorithm starts at the beginning of the collection.

2. Check each element: It checks each element one by one, starting from the first element, until either the target element is found or the end of the collection is reached.

3. Comparison with the target: At each step, it compares the current element with the target element.

4. Search termination: If the current element matches the target element, the search is successful, and the index of the target element is returned.
If the entire collection is traversed without finding the target element, the search is unsuccessful, and a special value (such as -1) is returned to indicate that the target element is not present in the collection.

# Stacks

Its abstract data structure. works on **LIFO** principle - the last element added to the stacks will be the first element removed from the stacks.

think about a stack of plates, or a stack of ...anything. as you pile it up the last thing (top most thing) is what gets removed first.

**Where its used** -

- `managing function invocation`  
- `undo-redo`  
- `routing in history`

# Data Structures

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data in a computer's memory. It defines how data is arranged and how different operations (adding, removing, searching) can be performed efficiently.

There are two main categories of data structures:

A. **`Linear Data Structures:`**
Elements are arranged in a sequential order, like a line.
Accessing or modifying an element typically involves traversing through the sequence from the beginning.

Examples -

1. `Array:` A fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type, accessed using an index.
2. `Linked List:` A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. More flexible in size than arrays.
3. `Stack:` LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. Elements are added and removed from the "top" of the stack. Useful for keeping track of function calls, implementing undo/redo functionality.
4. `Queue:` FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. Elements are added to the "back" and removed from the "front" of the queue. Used for task scheduling, managing waiting lists, etc.

B. **`Non-Linear Data Structures:`**
Elements are not arranged in a strict linear order. They can have hierarchical or more complex relationships.

Examples:

1. `Tree:` A hierarchical structure where nodes have parent-child relationships. Useful for representing family trees, organizational structures, etc.
2. `Graph:` A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Used for modeling social networks, maps, representing relationships between objects.

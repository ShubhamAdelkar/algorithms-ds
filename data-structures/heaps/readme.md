# Heaps

similar to binary search trees, but with some different rules.
in a `maxBinaryHeaps`, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. in a `minBinaryHeaps`, parent nodes are always smaller than child.
binary heaps are used to implement priority queues.
also used a bit, with graph traversal.

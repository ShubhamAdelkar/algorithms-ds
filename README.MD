# Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript #

This repository aims to provideimplementations of various algorithms and data structures using JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand fundamental concepts or an experienced developer seeking to refresh your knowledge, this repository has something for everyone.

### 1. Recursion

Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. The `recursion` directory explores the concept of recursion in JavaScript, providing explanation, examples and exercises to help you grasp technique for solving problems.

### 2. Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are methods used to find a particular item (or items) with specified properties within a collection of data. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are widely used in various applications, including databases, information retrieval systems, and more.
Searching algorithms directory includes this - 1.`Linear Search` 2. `Binary Search` algorithms.

# Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript

This repository aims to provideimplementations of various algorithms and data structures using JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand fundamental concepts or an experienced developer seeking to refresh your knowledge, this repository has something for everyone.

### 1. Recursion

Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. The `recursion` directory explores the concept of recursion in JavaScript, providing explanation, examples and exercises to help you grasp technique for solving problems.

### 2. Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are methods used to find a particular item (or items) with specified properties within a collection of data. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are widely used in various applications, including databases, information retrieval systems, and more.
Searching algorithms - `Linear Search` `Binary Search`

### 3. Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are efficiently arranging elements in a list or array according to a specific order. **Organizing data:** Sorting allows you to arrange data in a meaningful way, such as sorting a list of names alphabetically or sorting product prices from low to high.
**Searching efficiently:** Once data is sorted, you can leverage more efficient search algorithms like binary search to quickly find specific elements.
Sorting algorithms - `Bubble Sort` `Selection Sort` `Insertion` `Merge` `Quick` & `Radix Sort`
